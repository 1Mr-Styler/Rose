# Rose
Since I'm so obsessed with knowing what I did and when I did it, I came up with this simple project that lets you add a 
jinfo.json file to the root folder of your project where you can list features and dates which those features were implemented.
You can download a copy of an empty jinfo.json file [here](https://lyshnia.com/downloads/jinfo.json).

To graphically view your projects jinfo.json, clone this project and navigate to /gui (Example: http://localhost/Rose/gui) and enter the path (Relative or Absolute) to your projects jinfo.json file.

#### Tips
Add the [jinfo.json](https://lyshnia.com/downloads/jinfo.json) file you downloaded to <b>File and Templates</b> section of your IntelliJ IDEA editor and it'll automatically fill in the preset fields.

## Example
This is a preview of the [jinfo.json](https://github.com/1Mr-Styler/Rose/blob/master/jinfo.json) of this project:
